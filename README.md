# snatcher-cli üöÄ

> *I originally coded this tool after a frustrating incident where I lost my production code and realized I had sourcemaps still live. Instead of rewriting everything, I wanted an automated way to ‚Äúsnatch‚Äù my own code back from those `.map` files. Now you can, too!*

A CLI tool to **snatch** the **main** sourcemap from your production React (or similar Webpack-based) app and reconstruct your **actual** code. No more rummaging through node\_modules or weird bundler files ‚Äî just the good stuff (like your `src/App.js`)!

When `snatcher-cli` runs, it:

1. Fetches the **main HTML** from your site.
2. Locates the **first script** whose path includes `"main"`.
3. Extracts the `//# sourceMappingURL=...` comment from that script.
4. Downloads the `.map` file and **rebuilds** the source files it contains ‚Äî **skipping** anything that has `node_modules/` or `webpack/` in the path.
5. Creates a **snatch-report.json** in your output folder with metadata about what it did and a list of any `node_modules` packages it sees (but doesn‚Äôt download).

## Features

- **Automagic Discovery**: No need to guess your hashed filenames. `snatcher-cli` sees whatever the HTML references for your ‚Äúmain‚Äù script.
- **Selective Recovery**: It **omits** all the `node_modules` or `webpack`-related stuff in the sourcemap, focusing on your own code.
- **Image Stub Replacement**: Spots lines like `__webpack_public_path__ + "static/media/Logo.123abc.png"` and fetches the **real** image file for you.
- **JSON Reporting**: You get a `snatch-report.json` summarizing the job, listing packages that might be in your `node_modules`, etc.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g snatcher-cli
```

This installs the CLI command `snatcher-cli` globally so you can run it anywhere.\
*(Or use **`npx`** if you prefer not to install globally.)*

---

## Usage

Run `snatcher-cli` by providing the **public URL** of your site, followed by any options:

```bash
snatcher-cli <baseUrl> [options]
```

### Required Argument
- **`<baseUrl>`**  
  The top-level URL where your React/CRA app is hosted. Examples:
    - `https://myusername.github.io/my-react-app/`
    - `https://example.com/subfolder/`

### Options
- **`-o, --output <dir>`** (default: `recovered-files`)  
  The folder in which to place the reconstructed files and the JSON report.
- **`-d, --debug`**  
  Prints extra logs for troubleshooting or curiosity.

### Quick Example
```bash
snatcher-cli https://myusername.github.io/my-react-app/ -o recovered-code -d
```
This will:
1. Fetch the page at `https://myusername.github.io/my-react-app/`
2. Locate the first `<script>` whose `src` contains `"main"`
3. Snatch its `.map` file (if found)
4. Rebuild only the source files that matter (skipping `node_modules/` or `webpack/` paths)
5. Place everything in `recovered-code/` along with a `snatch-report.json`

Use `--debug` if you want to see each step and URL request.

## JSON Report

After each run, you‚Äôll see a `` in the output folder, containing:

- The site you scanned (e.g. `"https://myusername.github.io/my-react-app/"`).
- The actual `.map` URL discovered (e.g. `"https://.../main.abc123.js.map"`).
- When the snatching happened.
- How many sources the sourcemap contained.
- How many sources were written to disk (i.e. your custom code).
- How many sources were ignored (e.g. node\_modules).
- A list of package names gleaned from any references that contained `node_modules/<packageName>` in their path.

It might look something like:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://myusername.github.io/my-react-app/",
  "mapUrl": "https://myusername.github.io/my-react-app/static/js/main.abc123.js.map",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-01T12:34:56.789Z",
  "totalSources": 40,
  "writtenSources": 10,
  "skippedSources": 30,
  "possibleNodePackages": ["react", "react-dom", "scheduler"]
}
```

## Skipping Node Modules

By default, `snatcher-cli` checks if a file path includes `node_modules/` or `webpack/`. If so, it **skips** writing that file to your local system. Instead, it just **logs** the package name in the report.

Why? Because you probably don‚Äôt need the entire `node_modules` tree ‚Äî just your own actual code. This also helps avoid pulling in thousands of files.

---

## Limitations & Warnings

1. **‚ÄúMain‚Äù Only**: We only look for the first script containing `main`. If your app splits into multiple chunks or code-splits everything, those might not be recovered.
2. **Must Actually Deploy **``: If your production build is configured to disable or remove `.map` files, `snatcher-cli` can‚Äôt snatch anything.
3. **Embedded **`` Required: We rely on the `.map` having real code in `sourcesContent`. If it‚Äôs referencing external files that aren‚Äôt included, you‚Äôll get partial or no code.
4. **Use on Your Own Code**: This is meant for **your** code or code you have explicit rights to. Respect others‚Äô IP.
5. **Naive Filter**: If you need stricter or different filtering (e.g., only `src/` files, or ignoring tests), adapt it in the script.
